# Mask-R-CNN
Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is an advanced deep learning model for instance segmentation in computer vision. It extends the Faster R-CNN architecture by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks. The model processes images through a backbone network, typically a pre-trained CNN like ResNet, to extract features. It then uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate potential object regions. The key innovation is the introduction of a "mask head" that predicts a binary mask for each detected object, enabling pixel-precise segmentation. Mask R-CNN employs RoIAlign, a layer that preserves spatial information, replacing the RoIPool used in Faster R-CNN. This allows for more accurate alignment between input features and output predictions. The model is trained end-to-end, optimizing for object classification, bounding box regression, and mask prediction simultaneously. Mask R-CNN excels in tasks requiring both object detection and precise segmentation, such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis.
